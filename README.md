# Upgraded Smart Contract using UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)


## Background

Traditional smart contracts deployed on the blockchain are immutable, meaning once deployed, their code cannot be changed. However, with the rapid evolution of blockchain technology and the need for bug fixes and feature upgrades, upgradeable smart contracts have gained prominence. UUPS is one such standard that allows developers to upgrade the contract logic while preserving the contract's address and state.

## Features

- UUPS-compatible implementation for upgradeable smart contracts.
- Secure and transparent upgrade mechanism.
- Separation of contract logic and data to ensure smooth upgrades.
- Gas-efficient upgrade process.
- Comprehensive example demonstrating the upgrade process.

## Upgradeability Risks

It's essential to be aware of potential risks associated with upgradable contracts. While UUPS offers a secure upgrade mechanism, it's crucial to thoroughly test upgrades and have a well-defined upgrade process to mitigate any unexpected issues. Always exercise caution when upgrading a contract on the mainnet to avoid loss of funds or disruptions to the contract's functionality.
